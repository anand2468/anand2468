# Data Structures & Algorithm
## *Dynamic Programming*
* It is used to solve optimal problems.
* The problems which have overlaping substructured pattern is solved using _dp_.
* There are two approaches in *dp*, `top-down-approach` and `bottom-up-approach`.

### Top Down Approach ⬇️ 
  it is also called as *momoization*. Generaly recurson is used in top down approach
### Bottom Up Approach ⬆️
  It is also called as *tabulation*. *Iteration* is used in this process
